This project consists of scripts, ImageJ macros, and other miscellany developed
at the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI).

These scripts were developed for specific research problems at LOCI. For other
use cases they would generally need some customization or tweaking. While we do
not offer official support for them, feel free to write to the [LOCI Software
mailing list](http://loci.wisc.edu/software/mailing-lists) with any questions.
